# Coding Guidelines:
**Value clarity, simplicity and readability**: As simple as possible, readable and explicit code. Avoid premature optimization. Avoid premature abstractions.
**Verify Information**: Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.
**File-by-File Changes**: Make changes file by file and give me a chance to spot mistakes.
**No Apologies**: Never use apologies.
**No Understanding Feedback**: Avoid giving feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.
**No Whitespace Suggestions**: Don't suggest whitespace changes.
**No Inventions**: Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested.
**No Unnecessary Confirmations**: Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context.
**Preserve Existing Code**: Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities. Pay attention to preserving existing structures.
**Single Chunk Edits**: Provide all edits in a single chunk instead of multiple-step instructions or explanations for the same file.
**No Implementation Checks**: Don't ask the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context.
**No Unnecessary Updates**: Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.
**Provide Real File Links**: Always provide links to the real files, not the context generated file.
**No Current Implementation**: Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.
**Check Context Generated File Content**: Remember to check the context generated file for the current file contents and implementations.
**Use Explicit Variable Names**: Prefer descriptive, explicit variable names over short, ambiguous ones to enhance code readability.
**Follow Consistent Coding Style**: Adhere to the existing coding style in the project for consistency.
**Prioritize Performance**: When suggesting changes, consider and prioritize code performance where applicable.
**Test Coverage**: Suggest or include appropriate unit tests for new or modified code.
**Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging where necessary.
**Modular Design**: Encourage modular design principles to improve code maintainability and reusability.
**Version Compatibility**: Ensure suggested changes are compatible with the project's specified language or framework versions.
**Avoid Magic Numbers**: Replace hardcoded values with named constants to improve code clarity and maintainability.
**Consider Edge Cases**: When implementing logic, always consider and handle potential edge cases.
**Use Assertions**: Include assertions wherever possible to validate assumptions and catch potential errors early.

# These rules will help you write clean, efficient, and maintainable Python code:
- **Use Meaningful Names**: Choose descriptive variable, function, and class names.
- **Follow PEP 8**: Adhere to the Python Enhancement Proposal 8 style guide for formatting.
- **Use Docstrings**: Document functions and classes with docstrings to explain their purpose.
- **Keep It Simple**: Write simple and clear code; avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **Use List Comprehensions**: Prefer list comprehensions for creating lists over traditional loops when appropriate.
- **Handle Exceptions**: Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
- **Write Tests**: Implement unit tests to ensure code reliability.
- **Use Type Hints**: Utilize type hints for better code clarity and type checking.
- **Avoid Global Variables**: Limit the use of global variables to reduce side effects.
