# Task ID: 7
# Title: Requirements Prediction Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a service to analyze Telegram chats and codebase to predict potential requirements and issues for project tracking.
# Details:
1. Implement natural language processing for requirement identification in chat messages
2. Create pattern recognition for common requirement phrases
3. Develop code analysis to identify potential requirements from implementation
4. Implement clustering algorithm to group related discussions
5. Create confidence scoring for predicted requirements
6. Develop notification system for high-confidence predictions
7. Implement feedback mechanism for improving predictions
8. Create API endpoints for requirement predictions

# Test Strategy:
Test requirement identification with sample chat messages. Validate pattern recognition for requirement phrases. Test code analysis with sample repositories. Evaluate clustering algorithm with test data. Verify confidence scoring with known requirements.
