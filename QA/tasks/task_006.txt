# Task ID: 6
# Title: RAG System Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system to provide context-aware responses based on indexed documentation, code, and chat history.
# Details:
1. Select and integrate a suitable language model (e.g., OpenAI API, Hugging Face models)
2. Implement vector similarity search for relevant context retrieval
3. Create prompt engineering templates for different use cases
4. Develop context augmentation logic to enhance model responses
5. Implement caching mechanism for frequent queries
6. Add fallback mechanisms for when context is insufficient
7. Create API endpoints for RAG queries
8. Implement response filtering and post-processing

# Test Strategy:
Test vector similarity search with sample queries. Validate context retrieval relevance. Evaluate model responses with and without context augmentation. Benchmark response times with caching. Test API endpoints for RAG queries.
