# Description: Develop a system to track the completeness of requirements based on code implementation and associated GitHub issues.
# Details:
1. Define completeness metrics for requirements
2. Implement mapping between requirements and GitHub issues
3. Track code changes associated with requirements
4. Create status tracking for requirement implementation stages
5. Develop visualization for requirement completion progress
6. Implement notifications for stalled requirements
7. Create API endpoints for requirement completeness data
