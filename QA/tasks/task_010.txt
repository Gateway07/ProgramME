# Task ID: 10
# Title: Documentation Update Prediction
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a system to predict necessary documentation updates based on code changes and discussions in Telegram chats.
# Details:
1. Analyze code changes to identify affected documentation sections
2. Implement diff analysis between code versions
3. Extract relevant discussions from Telegram about documentation
4. Generate suggested documentation updates using RAG
5. Create confidence scoring for suggested updates
6. Implement notification system for technical writers
7. Develop preview functionality for suggested changes
8. Create API endpoints for documentation update suggestions

# Test Strategy:
Test identification of affected documentation with sample code changes. Validate diff analysis with version history. Test extraction of relevant discussions from sample chats. Evaluate generated documentation updates for accuracy. Verify notification system for technical writers.
