# Feature: Contextual Information Retrieval

## 1. Description

This feature empowers users to find interconnected pieces of information across various platforms (Telegram, GitHub, Documentation). Given an input requirement, a documentation topic, or even a code snippet, the system will retrieve related Telegram discussions, GitHub code changes/issues, and relevant documentation sections.

## 2. Functional Requirements

- **FR6.1: Unified Search Interface:**
  - Provide a search interface where users can input a query (e.g., requirement ID, documentation keyword, issue title, code function name).
- **FR6.2: Cross-Platform Search Execution:**
  - The system will query the indexed data (from Feature 1 & 2) across Markdown documentation, GitHub codebase, GitHub issues, and Telegram chats.
- **FR6.3: Retrieval of Related Telegram Discussions:**
  - Based on the input query, find and display relevant message threads or individual messages from the indexed Telegram chats.
  - Utilize semantic search (FR2.5) for contextual relevance.
- **FR6.4: Retrieval of Related GitHub Code Changes/Issues:**
  - Based on the input query, find and display relevant commits, pull requests, code files, or issues from the indexed GitHub data.
  - Link directly to the items on GitHub.
- **FR6.5: Retrieval of Related Documentation Sections:**
  - Based on the input query, find and display relevant sections or pages from the indexed Markdown documentation.
  - Link directly to the documentation files/sections.
- **FR6.6: Relevance Ranking and Filtering:**
  - Present search results ranked by relevance.
  - Allow users to filter results by source (Telegram, GitHub Code, GitHub Issues, Documentation) and potentially by date or other metadata.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR6.1: Performance:** Search results should be returned quickly.
- **NFR6.2: Relevance:** The system must be effective at identifying truly related items across the different data sources.
- **NFR6.3: User-Friendliness:** The search interface and presentation of results should be intuitive.
- **NFR6.4: Comprehensiveness:** The search should cover all configured and indexed data sources thoroughly.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC6.1:** A user can input a requirement ID and retrieve related Telegram discussions, GitHub commits/issues, and documentation sections.
- **AC6.2:** A user can input a keyword from a documentation topic and retrieve related Telegram discussions and GitHub code/issues.
- **AC6.3:** Search results are presented with links to the original sources (Telegram messages, GitHub items, documentation files).
- **AC6.4:** Users can filter search results by data source (e.g., show only Telegram results).
- **AC6.5:** The relevance ranking of search results is generally accurate and helpful.
