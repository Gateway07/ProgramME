# Feature: Automated Q&A Generation for Support

## 1. Description

This feature aims to reduce the time and improve the quality of answers provided by the support team. It involves generating a comprehensive Question & Answer (Q&A) index from the project's documentation, GitHub issues (especially resolved ones with solutions), and potentially common questions discussed in Telegram chats. This Q&A index will serve as a quick reference for the support team.

## 2. Functional Requirements

- **FR7.1: Q&A Pair Extraction/Generation:**
  - Analyze indexed Markdown documentation to identify potential question-answer pairs (e.g., from FAQs, headings, or specific content structures).
  - Analyze resolved GitHub issues to extract problem descriptions (questions) and their solutions/comments (answers).
  - Optionally, analyze recurring questions and their answers from indexed Telegram support-related chats.
  - Utilize LLMs to rephrase or generate clear Q&A pairs from the extracted information.
- **FR7.2: Q&A Index Creation:**
  - Store the generated Q&A pairs in a searchable index (could be part of the PostgreSQL database from FR2 or a dedicated search engine).
- **FR7.3: Support Team Interface for Q&A:**
  - Provide an interface for the support team to search the Q&A index.
  - Allow searching by keywords, full questions, or topics.
- **FR7.4: Link to Source Material:**
  - Each Q&A pair should, where possible, link back to the original source document, GitHub issue, or Telegram message for more context.
- **FR7.5: Feedback and Curation:**
  - Allow support team members to rate the usefulness of Q&A pairs.
  - Provide a mechanism for suggesting new Q&A pairs or improvements to existing ones.
- **FR7.6: Regular Updates to Q&A Index:**
  - Ensure the Q&A index is regularly updated as new documentation is added, issues are resolved, or new information becomes available.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR7.1: Accuracy & Relevance:** The generated Q&A pairs must be accurate and relevant to potential support queries.
- **NFR7.2: Search Performance:** The Q&A search interface must be fast and responsive.
- **NFR7.3: Comprehensiveness:** The Q&A index should cover a wide range of common and complex issues.
- **NFR7.4: Maintainability:** The Q&A generation and indexing process should be easy to maintain and update.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC7.1:** The system can automatically extract or generate Q&A pairs from project documentation.
- **AC7.2:** The system can extract Q&A pairs from resolved GitHub issues.
- **AC7.3:** A searchable Q&A index is created and accessible to the support team.
- **AC7.4:** Support team members can search the Q&A index and find relevant answers to common questions.
- **AC7.5:** Q&A pairs include links to their original source material.
- **AC7.6:** The Q&A index is updated periodically to reflect new information.
