# Feature: Requirement Prediction

## 1. Description

This feature aims to proactively identify potential new requirements or modifications to existing ones. It will analyze discussions in Telegram chats and recent changes in the GitHub codebase to suggest relevant requirements to project managers and team leaders.

## 2. Functional Requirements

- **FR3.1: Code-Based Requirement Suggestion:**
  - Analyze commit messages, code changes (diffs), and new module additions in the GitHub codebase.
  - Identify patterns or significant changes that might indicate unstated requirements or scope creep.
  - Generate suggestions for new requirements or updates to existing ones based on these code activities.
- **FR3.2: Telegram-Based Requirement Suggestion:**
  - Monitor specified Telegram chats for discussions related to new features, problems, or desired enhancements.
  - Use NLP and LLM capabilities to understand the context and intent of these discussions.
  - Generate suggestions for new requirements based on identified needs or ideas from Telegram conversations.
- **FR3.3: Requirement Suggestion Dashboard/Interface:**
  - Provide an interface where project managers and team leaders can view predicted requirements.
  - Display the source of the suggestion (e.g., specific commit, Telegram message thread).
  - Allow users to accept, reject, or modify suggested requirements.
- **FR3.4: Link to Source:**
  - For each suggestion, provide direct links to the relevant GitHub commit(s) or Telegram message(s) that triggered the prediction.
- **FR3.5: Feedback Loop:**
  - Allow users to provide feedback on the quality and relevance of predictions to help refine the underlying models.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR3.1: Accuracy:** The prediction model should strive for a high degree of accuracy in suggesting relevant requirements.
- **NFR3.2: Timeliness:** Predictions should be generated in a timely manner to be actionable.
- **NFR3.3: User-Friendliness:** The interface for viewing and managing suggestions should be intuitive and easy to use.
- **NFR3.4: Configurability:** Allow administrators to configure the sensitivity of the prediction models and the sources (specific repositories/chats) to monitor.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC3.1:** The system can analyze GitHub commits and suggest potential requirements based on code changes.
- **AC3.2:** The system can analyze Telegram chat discussions and suggest potential requirements based on conversations.
- **AC3.3:** Project managers can view a list of predicted requirements with their sources.
- **AC3.4:** Users can accept a predicted requirement, which can then (optionally) be used to pre-fill a new issue in the GitHub issue tracker.
- **AC3.5:** The system provides links back to the original GitHub commit or Telegram discussion for each suggestion.
