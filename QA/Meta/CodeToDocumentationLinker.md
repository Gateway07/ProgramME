# Feature: Code-to-Documentation Linker

## 1. Code Change Tracking

Effective tracking of code changes is fundamental to keeping documentation synchronized with the codebase.

**Methods for Monitoring Code Changes:**
- **Git Hooks (Post-Commit/Post-Merge):**
    - Implement server-side Git hooks (e.g., `post-receive`) or integrate with CI/CD pipelines that trigger on `post-commit` or `post-merge` events. This allows for real-time processing of changes pushed to central repositories.
    - For pull requests (PRs), a check can be integrated that analyzes changes before merging, providing early feedback.
- **Periodic Scanning of Repositories:**
    - For repositories where real-time hooks are not feasible, or as a fallback, the system can periodically scan repositories for new commits since the last scan. The frequency of scanning can be configured (e.g., hourly, daily).
- **Analyzing Pull Requests (PRs):**
    - Integrate with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket to analyze the diff of PRs. This is often the most effective point as PRs usually represent a complete feature or fix.

**Information to Capture:**
- **Changed Files:** A list of all files added, modified, or deleted.
- **Specific Code Entities:**
    - **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Parsing:** For supported programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, JavaScript), parse the code to identify changes at a granular level:
        - Modified or newly added functions, classes, methods, interfaces, and public variables/constants.
        - Changes to function signatures (parameters, return types).
        - Deletions of any of the above.
    - **Diff Analysis:** For languages where AST parsing is complex or not yet supported, use diff analysis to pinpoint changed blocks of code.
- **Commit Messages:** Capture commit messages associated with the changes. These often contain summaries of the changes and intent.
- **Author(s):** Identify the author(s) of the commit or PR.
- **Branch Information:** Note the branch where changes were made, especially for feature branches.
- **Timestamps:** Record when the change was committed/merged.

## 2. Linking Code to Documentation

Once a code change is detected, the system needs to identify the corresponding documentation sections that might be affected.

**Strategies for Identifying Relevant Documentation:**
- **Code Entity Name Matching:**
    - Extract names of modified/new functions, classes, methods, etc.
    - Perform a search (exact and fuzzy) for these names within the existing documentation (stored in the Postgres DB or indexed via the RAG process).
    - Prioritize matches found in headers, titles, or specially marked code reference sections.
- **Code Comments Referencing Documentation:**
    - Encourage developers to include special comment tags in their code that directly link to documentation pages or section IDs (e.g., `// See docs: user_authentication.md#login-function` or `@doc_link("user_auth_api")`).
    - The system will parse these comments and establish direct links.
- **AI/NLP Techniques for Semantic Similarity:**
    - **Embeddings:** Generate vector embeddings for code snippets (e.g., function bodies, class definitions) and documentation sections.
    - **Semantic Search:** When a code entity changes, use its embedding to find semantically similar documentation sections, even if the naming is not exact. This helps find conceptual links, not just keyword matches. This aligns with the existing RAG setup.
    - **Topic Modeling:** Identify topics within code changes and documentation to find matches.
- **Manual Mapping Repository:**
    - Allow technical writers to create and maintain a explicit mapping file or database table that links specific code modules/files/classes to corresponding documentation pages. This is useful for high-level architectural components.
- **Docstrings Analysis:**
    - For languages that support docstrings (e.g., Python), analyze the content of docstrings. Changes in docstrings might directly translate to documentation updates or indicate related documentation.

**Handling New Code Entities:**
- If a new function, class, or significant module is added and no existing documentation is found through the above methods:
    - The system will flag this as requiring new documentation.
    - It can suggest a potential title or section based on the entity's name and its context (e.g., module name).
    - It can also analyze similar existing code entities and their documentation structure to suggest a template or relevant sections to include.

## 3. Presenting Discrepancies and Suggestions

The goal is to provide actionable insights to technical writers and developers to keep documentation up-to-date.

**Workflow for Notification:**
- **Automated Issue Creation:**
    - Integrate with issue tracking systems (e.g., GitHub Issues, Jira).
    - When a code change potentially impacts documentation or requires new documentation, automatically create an issue.
    - Assign the issue to a specific technical writer, a writers' pool, or the developer who made the code change.
    - Pre-fill the issue with details: link to commit/PR, changed files, specific code entities, suggested documentation sections, and reason for the suggestion.
- **Email Notifications:**
    - For urgent updates or as an alternative, send email notifications to relevant stakeholders.
- **Dedicated Dashboard:**
    - A web-based dashboard where technical writers can see a prioritized list of code changes requiring documentation attention.
    - The dashboard can show the status of each item (e.g., pending review, docs updated, not applicable).
    - Allow filtering by project, repository, author, or type of change.

**Presenting Suggested Changes:**
- **Side-by-Side View:** For identified discrepancies, if possible, present a side-by-side view showing the relevant code snippet (old vs. new if applicable) and the potentially outdated documentation section.
- **Direct Links:** Provide direct links to the specific lines of code that changed in the repository and the relevant sections in the live documentation or editing interface.
- **Highlighted Sections:** In the documentation view, highlight the sections that are potentially impacted.
- **Clear Explanations:** For each suggestion, provide a brief explanation of why the system flagged it (e.g., "Function `getUserProfile` signature changed, corresponding API docs may need update," or "New class `PaymentProcessor` added, consider creating a new documentation page.").
- **Confidence Scores:** If AI/NLP methods are used, display a confidence score with the suggestion to help prioritize.

## 4. Alignment with PRD Goals

This "Code-to-Documentation Linker" feature directly supports and enhances several key objectives outlined in the `QA/Meta/prd.md`:

- **"Make predicted documentation updates based on codebase changes." (High-level Goal & Opportunity 4):** This is the primary focus of the feature. By tracking code modifications and linking them to documentation, the system directly predicts and pinpoints areas where documentation needs updating.
- **"Full integration of all information flows between project's documentation, Github issues tracker, Telegram chats and code base" (Problem 5):** This feature strengthens the link between the codebase and project documentation, contributing to the overall information flow integration. Specifically, it addresses the connection between 5.1 (documentation) and 5.4 (codebase).
- **"Project documentation is more stable and included proved information." (Problem 5.1):** By ensuring documentation is quickly updated after code changes, it remains accurate and reflects the "proved information" from the codebase, rather than becoming stale.
- **"Reduce time to update documentation based on predicted changes from Telegram and codebase." (Primary KPI 4):** This feature directly targets this KPI by automating the detection of necessary documentation updates stemming from codebase changes, thereby reducing the manual effort and time required by technical writers.
- **"Setup RAG process and make index of docs, codebase and Telegram chats." (High-level Goal):**
    - The linking process itself can benefit from the indexed codebase and documentation within the RAG system (e.g., for semantic search).
    - Conversely, the metadata generated by this linker (e.g., verified links between code and docs) can further enrich the RAG index, making it more knowledgeable about these relationships.

By proactively identifying documentation needs based on actual code development, this feature aims to reduce documentation debt, improve accuracy, and ensure that documentation remains a reliable resource for users and developers alike.I have created the feature description document `QA/Meta/CodeToDocumentationLinker.md` which includes:
1.  **Code Change Tracking**: Methods (Git hooks, periodic scanning, PR analysis) and information to capture (changed files/entities, commit messages, authors).
2.  **Linking Code to Documentation**: Strategies (name matching, code comments, AI/NLP, manual mapping, docstrings) and handling new code entities.
3.  **Presenting Discrepancies and Suggestions**: Notification workflows (issue creation, email, dashboard) and presentation methods (side-by-side diffs, links, highlights).
4.  **Alignment with PRD Goals**: Explicit connections to PRD points like "predicted documentation updates based on codebase changes" and improving information flow.

I believe this document fulfills the requirements of the subtask.
