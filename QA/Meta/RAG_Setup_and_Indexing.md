# Feature: RAG Setup and Indexing

## 1. Description

This feature focuses on establishing the foundational Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) process. It includes the capability to ingest and index content from multiple sources to enable effective information retrieval.

## 2. Functional Requirements

- **FR1.1: RAG Process Implementation:**
  - Develop and configure a RAG pipeline capable of leveraging indexed data for question answering and information retrieval.
- **FR1.2: Markdown Documentation Indexing:**
  - Implement a module to parse and index Markdown (.md) documentation files.
  - Extract relevant text, structure, and metadata.
- **FR1.3: GitHub Codebase Indexing:**
  - Implement a module to connect to GitHub repositories and index the codebase.
  - Extract code snippets, comments, and relevant metadata (e.g., file paths, commit history).
- **FR1.4: GitHub Issues Indexing:**
  - Implement a module to fetch and index GitHub issues (including descriptions, comments, labels, and status).
- **FR1.5: Telegram Chats Indexing:**
  - Implement a module to ingest and index messages from specified Telegram chats.
  - Capture text content, sender information, timestamps, and any relevant media or links.
- **FR1.6: Configurable Indexing:**
  - Allow administrators to configure data sources, indexing frequency, and specific repositories/chats to be included.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR1.1: Scalability:** The indexing process should be scalable to handle large volumes of data from all sources.
- **NFR1.2: Updatability:** The index should be efficiently updatable to reflect new or modified content in the source systems.
- **NFR1.3: Fault Tolerance:** The indexing process should be resilient to transient errors from external APIs (e.g., GitHub, Telegram).

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC1.1:** The RAG system can be successfully set up and configured.
- **AC1.2:** Content from Markdown files within a specified directory can be successfully indexed.
- **AC1.3:** Code and metadata from a specified GitHub repository can be successfully indexed.
- **AC1.4:** Issues from a specified GitHub repository can be successfully indexed.
- **AC1.5:** Messages from a specified Telegram chat can be successfully indexed.
- **AC1.6:** The system allows for periodic re-indexing or incremental updates of the indexed data.
