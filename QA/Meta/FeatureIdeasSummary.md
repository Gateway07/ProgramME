# Summary of Proposed Feature Ideas for the QA Project

## Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of three new feature ideas proposed to enhance the capabilities of the QA project. Each feature aims to address specific challenges and opportunities outlined in the project's Product Requirements Document (PRD), focusing on improving documentation processes, knowledge management, and productivity tracking. Detailed descriptions for each feature can be found in their respective Markdown files.

## Feature Ideas

### 1. Automated FAQ Generation from Telegram Chats

*   **Summary:** This feature proposes a system to automatically identify and extract question-and-answer pairs from discussions in Telegram chats. By leveraging NLP and keyword analysis, it aims to capture valuable, practical solutions discussed by the team, which can then be reviewed by human moderators and integrated into a formal FAQ knowledge base. This will help in reducing repetitive questions and making information more accessible.

### 2. Code-to-Documentation Linker

*   **Summary:** The Code-to-Documentation Linker is designed to maintain synchronization between the codebase and its corresponding documentation. It will track code changes (e.g., function modifications, new classes) and automatically identify potentially impacted documentation sections or flag the need for new documentation. This feature aims to reduce documentation staleness and ensure accuracy by prompting timely updates.

### 3. Enhanced Productivity Dashboard

*   **Summary:** This feature involves the creation of a comprehensive dashboard to track and visualize key productivity and project health metrics. It will aggregate data from various sources like version control, issue trackers, and the project's database to provide insights into code contributions, requirement completion, documentation health, and more. The dashboard will help project managers and team leaders monitor progress, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions.
