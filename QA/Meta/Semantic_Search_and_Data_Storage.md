# Feature: Semantic Search and Data Storage

## 1. Description

This feature focuses on the persistent storage of all indexed information and the implementation of advanced search capabilities. It leverages a PostgreSQL database for storing data and utilizes LLMs for generating semantic search indexes.

## 2. Functional Requirements

- **FR2.1: PostgreSQL Database Integration:**
  - Design and implement a PostgreSQL database schema to store indexed data from all sources (Markdown docs, GitHub codebase, GitHub issues, Telegram chats).
  - Ensure efficient storage and retrieval of text, metadata, and relationships between data points.
- **FR2.2: Data Ingestion into PostgreSQL:**
  - Develop processes to load the indexed data from FR1 into the PostgreSQL database.
- **FR2.3: Semantic Search Index Generation:**
  - Utilize a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate semantic embeddings for the indexed content.
  - Store these embeddings in the PostgreSQL database, potentially using extensions like `pgvector` for efficient similarity search.
- **FR2.4: Full-Text Search Capability:**
  - Implement robust full-text search functionality over the stored data in PostgreSQL.
  - Allow users to search using keywords and phrases across all indexed sources.
- **FR2.5: Semantic Search Capability:**
  - Implement semantic search functionality that allows users to find relevant information based on meaning and context, rather than just keywords.
  - This will use the generated semantic embeddings for similarity comparisons.
- **FR2.6: Combined Search (Hybrid):**
  - Optionally, provide a hybrid search capability that combines results from both full-text and semantic search for improved relevance.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR2.1: Performance:** Search queries (both full-text and semantic) should return results within an acceptable timeframe, even with large datasets.
- **NFR2.2: Data Integrity:** Ensure the accuracy and consistency of data stored in the PostgreSQL database.
- **NFR2.3: Scalability:** The database and search solution should scale to accommodate growing amounts of indexed data.
- **NFR2.4: Maintainability:** The database schema and search components should be well-documented and maintainable.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC2.1:** A PostgreSQL database schema is successfully created and can store data from all indexed sources.
- **AC2.2:** Indexed data is correctly ingested and stored in the PostgreSQL database.
- **AC2.3:** Semantic embeddings are generated for indexed content and stored appropriately.
- **AC2.4:** Users can perform full-text searches across all indexed content and receive relevant results.
- **AC2.5:** Users can perform semantic searches across all indexed content and receive contextually relevant results.
- **AC2.6:** The system can handle a predefined volume of data and search queries with acceptable performance.
