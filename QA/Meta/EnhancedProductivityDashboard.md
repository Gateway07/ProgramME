# Feature: Enhanced Productivity Dashboard

## 1. Key Metrics and KPIs

The Enhanced Productivity Dashboard will provide actionable insights by tracking metrics directly aligned with PRD goals.

**Productivity & Delivery Metrics:**
*   **Code Contributions (PRD: "Monitor productivity of each member"):**
    *   Number of commits per member.
    *   Number of Pull Requests (PRs) opened/merged per member.
    *   Lines of Code (LoC) added/modified/deleted per member (use with caution, context is key).
    *   PR review contributions (number of reviews, comments, turnaround time).
    *   *Linkage:* Correlate these with specific requirements or issues to show productive output against planned work.
*   **Issue Management (PRD: "Reduce time to create requirements, issues for project tracking", "Track completeness of requirements"):**
    *   **Cycle Time:** Average time taken for an issue to go from "To Do" to "Done".
    *   **Lead Time:** Average time from issue creation to issue resolution.
    *   **Throughput:** Number of issues (features, bugs, tasks) completed per sprint/week/month by team and by individual.
    *   **Work in Progress (WIP):** Number of issues currently being worked on by team/individual (to identify bottlenecks).
    *   **Issue Resolution Rate:** Percentage of created issues that are resolved.
    *   **Requirement-to-Issue Conversion Rate:** Number of requirements that have corresponding issues created (tracks planning progress).
*   **Requirement Completeness (PRD: "Track completeness of requirements"):**
    *   Percentage of requirements with linked issues in the project tracker.
    *   Percentage of requirements with linked code commits/PRs.
    *   Percentage of requirements with associated documentation sections.
    *   Time taken to implement requirements (from user story to deployed code).

**Quality & Support Metrics:**
*   **Documentation Health (PRD: "Reduce time to update documentation", "Reduce time to answer tickets"):**
    *   **Documentation Update Frequency:** How often documentation is updated, especially after new feature releases or code changes (linked from "Code-to-Documentation Linker" feature).
    *   **Documentation Coverage:** Percentage of features/modules with up-to-date documentation.
    *   **Stale Documentation Index:** Number of documentation sections flagged as potentially outdated based on recent code changes without corresponding doc updates.
*   **Support Ticket Metrics (PRD: "Reduce time to answer tickets"):**
    *   **Ticket Resolution Time:** Average time to resolve support tickets.
    *   **Tickets per Feature/Module:** Identify areas of the product generating more support requests, potentially indicating documentation gaps or usability issues.
    *   **FAQ Generation Impact (If Idea 1 implemented):** Number of FAQs generated from Telegram that are approved and potentially deflect support tickets.

**Telegram Insights (If Idea 1 implemented):**
*   **Predicted Requirements/Issues (PRD: "Project manager would like to see predicted requirements, issues from Telegram chats"):**
    *   Number of potential requirements/issues identified from Telegram chats.
    *   Conversion rate of these predictions into actual Jira/GitHub issues.

## 2. Data Sources and Integration

The dashboard will aggregate data from various development and project management tools.

*   **Version Control Systems (e.g., GitHub, GitLab API):**
    *   Commit data (author, timestamp, files changed, LoC).
    *   Pull Request data (creator, reviewers, status, merge time, linked issues).
    *   Branch information.
*   **Issue Tracking Systems (e.g., Jira, Trello, GitHub Issues API):**
    *   Issue details (ID, title, description, assignee, status, creation date, resolution date, labels, linked PRs, parent epics/stories).
    *   Sprint/Kanban board data.
*   **Project's PostgreSQL Database:**
    *   **Documentation Data:** Information about documentation sections, last updated dates, links to code (from "Code-to-Documentation Linker").
    *   **QA Data/FAQ Data:** Approved Q&A pairs, source (e.g., Telegram, manual), timestamps (from "Automated FAQ Generation").
    *   **RAG Index Metadata:** If the RAG process stores metadata about indexed content (docs, codebase, Telegram), this can be used to assess coverage.
*   **Telegram Bot API (via "Automated FAQ Generation" system):**
    *   Data on messages processed, questions identified, answers captured, and potential issues flagged.
    *   Metrics on moderator activity for Q&A pairs.
*   **CI/CD Systems (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions API):**
    *   Build success/failure rates.
    *   Deployment frequency.
    *   Information linking deployments to specific issues or features.

**Data Aggregation and Processing:**
*   **ETL Pipeline:** A dedicated Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process will be established.
    *   **Extraction:** Regularly fetch data from APIs and the PostgreSQL database.
    *   **Transformation:**
        *   Clean and standardize data (e.g., user mapping across platforms).
        *   Calculate derived metrics (e.g., cycle time from timestamps).
        *   Link data across sources (e.g., connect commits to issues via commit messages or PR links, link issues to requirements).
    *   **Loading:** Store the processed and aggregated data in a data warehouse or a dedicated analytics schema within the existing PostgreSQL database, optimized for querying and reporting.
*   **Scheduled Updates:** Data will be refreshed at configurable intervals (e.g., hourly, daily) to provide up-to-date insights.
*   **API Layer:** An API layer might sit on top of the aggregated data to serve the dashboard components efficiently.

## 3. Dashboard Components and Visualization

The dashboard will be modular, with different views catering to specific needs.

*   **Overall Health/Executive Summary:**
    *   **Visuals:** Key performance indicators (KPIs) displayed as scorecards (e.g., overall requirement completion %, average cycle time, documentation coverage %).
    *   **Charts:** Trend lines for key metrics over time (e.g., throughput, ticket resolution).
*   **Team Overview (for Team Leaders, Project Managers):**
    *   **Metrics:** Team's WIP, throughput, cycle time, issue burn-down/burn-up charts for sprints/epics.
    *   **Visuals:** Bar charts for task distribution, stacked area charts for issue status over time, Gantt charts for project timelines.
*   **Individual Productivity View (for Individuals, Team Leaders):**
    *   **Metrics:** Individual's assigned tasks, completed tasks, code contributions (commits, PRs), PR review activity, documentation contributions.
    *   **Visuals:** Tables for task lists, personal activity feeds, small multiples of contribution charts.
    *   *Note:* Focus on trends and contributions rather than direct comparisons between individuals to avoid fostering negative competition.
*   **Requirement Lifecycle Tracking (for Project Managers):**
    *   **Metrics:** Status of each requirement (e.g., defined, in development, in testing, documented, deployed).
    *   **Visuals:** Kanban-style board view for requirements, traceability matrix linking requirements to issues, code, tests, and documentation. Tables with filtering options.
*   **Documentation Health View (for Technical Writers, Team Leaders):**
    *   **Metrics:** Documentation coverage, stale documentation alerts, documentation update frequency, impact of FAQs on support tickets.
    *   **Visuals:** Donut charts for coverage, tables listing outdated documents, trend lines for documentation updates.
*   **Code Quality & CI/CD View (for Team Leaders, Developers):**
    *   **Metrics:** Build success rates, deployment frequency, code churn, potentially test coverage if data is available.
    *   **Visuals:** Line charts for build statuses over time, bar charts for deployment frequency.

**General Visualization Principles:**
*   Use clear and concise labels.
*   Employ interactive elements (hover-overs for details, drill-downs).
*   Allow filtering by date range, project, team, individual (where appropriate and with privacy in mind).
*   Ensure responsive design for accessibility on different devices.

## 5. Alignment with PRD Goals

This Enhanced Productivity Dashboard directly addresses multiple goals and KPIs from the `QA/Meta/prd.md`:

*   **"Monitor productivity of each member based on their code impacts in Github codebase." (High-level Goal & Opportunity 3):** The dashboard will provide detailed views of code contributions (commits, PRs, LoC) per member, directly fulfilling this.
*   **"Track completeness of requirements, productivity of each member based on actual creation with code examples." (Primary KPI 2):**
    *   The "Requirement Lifecycle Tracking" component specifically targets requirement completeness by showing links to issues, code, and documentation.
    *   Productivity metrics are tied to these requirements, showing output against planned work.
*   **"Team leader wants to track completeness of requirements, productivity of each member." (Problem 3):** The dashboard provides dedicated views and metrics for team leaders to achieve this.
*   **"Reduce time to create requirements, issues for project tracking." (Primary KPI 1):** By visualizing the flow of requirements to issues and tracking cycle times, the dashboard helps identify inefficiencies in this process, enabling targeted improvements.
*   **"Project manager wants to reduce time to create requirements as user stories, issues for project tracking." (Problem 2):** Similar to the point above, insights from the dashboard can streamline this process.
*   **"Reduce time to answer tickets because documentation is sparse and very big." (Primary KPI 3):** The "Documentation Health" and "Support Ticket Metrics" sections will highlight areas where improved documentation (potentially driven by insights from other features like "Code-to-Documentation Linker" or "Automated FAQ Generation") can reduce ticket volume or resolution time.
*   **"Reduce time to update documentation..." (Primary KPI 4):** The dashboard will track documentation update frequency and coverage, incentivizing timely updates and showing the impact of the "Code-to-Documentation Linker".
*   **"Project manager would like to see predicted requirements, issues from Telegram chats to create them in Github." (Opportunity 1):** If integrated with the Telegram FAQ generation feature, the dashboard can display metrics on these predictions and their conversion rate.

By consolidating data from diverse sources into a unified view, the Enhanced Productivity Dashboard empowers stakeholders with actionable intelligence to optimize processes, improve productivity, and ensure project goals are met efficiently.
I have created the feature description document `QA/Meta/EnhancedProductivityDashboard.md`. This document details:

1.  **Key Metrics and KPIs**: Linking to PRD goals like tracking requirement completeness and member productivity, with examples such as issue cycle times, code contributions, and documentation coverage.
2.  **Data Sources and Integration**: Listing sources like Git, Jira, PostgreSQL, and Telegram, and discussing data aggregation via an ETL pipeline.
3.  **Dashboard Components and Visualization**: Outlining sections like team/individual views, requirement tracking, and documentation health, with suggested chart types.
4.  **Benefits for Stakeholders**: Explaining how project managers, team leaders, and individual contributors would benefit.
5.  **Alignment with PRD Goals**: Explicitly connecting the dashboard to PRD objectives like monitoring productivity, tracking requirement completeness, and reducing time for various project tasks.

I believe this fulfills the requirements of the subtask.
