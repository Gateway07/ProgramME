# Feature: Predicted Documentation Updates

## 1. Description

This feature assists technical writers by automatically identifying parts of the documentation that may require updates based on recent changes in the GitHub codebase. It aims to streamline the documentation maintenance process and ensure documentation stays synchronized with the software.

## 2. Functional Requirements

- **FR5.1: Code Change Analysis for Documentation Impact:**
  - Analyze committed code changes (e.g., function signature modifications, API endpoint changes, new feature implementations, deprecations) in specified GitHub repositories.
  - Identify code changes that are likely to impact existing documentation.
- **FR5.2: Documentation Section Mapping (Optional but Recommended):**
  - Implement or leverage a system to map code modules/functions/classes to relevant sections in the Markdown documentation (e.g., using special comments in code or a separate mapping file).
  - This improves the accuracy of identifying which documentation parts are affected.
- **FR5.3: Update Suggestion Generation:**
  - Based on the analysis, generate suggestions for documentation updates.
  - For each suggestion, indicate the affected documentation section(s) and the nature of the code change that triggered it.
- **FR5.4: Documentation Update Interface:**
  - Provide an interface for technical writers to review these suggestions.
  - Display the relevant code changes (diffs) and links to the affected documentation files.
  - Allow writers to accept, dismiss, or modify suggestions.
- **FR5.5: Link to Code Changes:**
  - For each suggestion, provide direct links to the GitHub commit(s) or pull request(s) that prompted the documentation update prediction.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR5.1: Accuracy:** The system should accurately identify code changes that necessitate documentation updates and pinpoint the relevant documentation sections.
- **NFR5.2: Relevance:** Suggestions should be highly relevant to avoid overwhelming technical writers with false positives.
- **NFR5.3: Timeliness:** Predictions should be available shortly after code changes are merged.
- **NFR5.4: User-Friendliness:** The interface for reviewing suggestions should be clear and efficient for technical writers.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC5.1:** The system can analyze new commits in a GitHub repository and identify changes relevant to documentation.
- **AC5.2:** The system suggests specific documentation sections that may need updates based on detected code changes.
- **AC5.3:** Technical writers can view a list of predicted documentation updates, including the source code change and the potentially affected documentation files.
- **AC5.4:** The system provides direct links to the relevant commits or PRs for each suggestion.
- **AC5.5:** If a mapping between code and documentation exists, the system uses it to improve the precision of its suggestions.
