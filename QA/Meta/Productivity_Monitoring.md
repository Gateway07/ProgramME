# Feature: Productivity Monitoring

## 1. Description

This feature provides tools for project managers and team leaders to monitor and assess the productivity of team members. It primarily focuses on analyzing contributions to the GitHub codebase, such as commit frequency, code volume, and impact of changes. It can also incorporate data from Telegram discussions related to tasks and requirements.

## 2. Functional Requirements

- **FR4.1: GitHub Contribution Analysis:**
  - Track and analyze individual developer contributions to specified GitHub repositories.
  - Metrics to include: commit frequency, lines of code added/deleted/modified, complexity of changes (e.g., using cyclomatic complexity or similar heuristics), number of pull requests created/merged.
- **FR4.2: Requirement-Productivity Linking (Code):**
  - Correlate GitHub contributions (commits, PRs) with specific requirements or issues in the GitHub issue tracker.
  - Provide insights into which requirements are being actively worked on and by whom.
- **FR4.3: Telegram Activity Correlation (Optional):**
  - Analyze participation in relevant Telegram discussions related to assigned tasks or requirements.
  - Provide insights into engagement and collaborative efforts (this should be handled carefully to respect privacy and context).
- **FR4.4: Productivity Dashboard:**
  - Present productivity metrics and trends in a clear, visual dashboard.
  - Allow filtering by team member, repository, time period, and requirement/issue.
- **FR4.5: Reporting:**
  - Generate summarized productivity reports for individuals and teams.
- **FR4.6: Completeness Tracking (Requirements):**
  - Track the completeness of requirements by linking them to code changes and issue status updates.
  - Provide an overview of progress for each requirement.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR4.1: Accuracy:** Ensure that contribution data is accurately attributed and calculated.
- **NFR4.2: Performance:** The dashboard and report generation should be responsive.
- **NFR4.3: Data Privacy:** If Telegram data is used, ensure that privacy considerations are paramount and data is used ethically and with transparency.
- **NFR4.4: Configurability:** Allow customization of metrics and what constitutes 'active' contribution.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC4.1:** The system can track and display commit history and code change metrics for individual developers from specified GitHub repositories.
- **AC4.2:** The system can link GitHub commits and PRs to specific issues/requirements in the tracker.
- **AC4.3:** A dashboard is available that visualizes individual and team productivity metrics over time.
- **AC4.4:** Project managers can generate reports summarizing developer contributions and requirement progress.
- **AC4.5:** The system can show the percentage of requirements completed based on linked code changes and issue statuses.
