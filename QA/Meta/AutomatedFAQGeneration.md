# Feature: Automated FAQ Generation from Telegram Chats

## 1. Telegram Chat Data Ingestion

The system will ingest Telegram chat data using the Telegram Bot API. A dedicated bot will be added to the relevant Telegram groups and channels.

**Access and Processing:**
- The bot will be granted read-only access to messages.
- It will listen for new messages and process them in real-time or near real-time.
- For historical data, a one-time export of chat history can be performed using Telegram's export feature, which can then be parsed and processed by a separate script.

**Privacy and Permissions:**
- The bot will only process messages from groups/channels it has been explicitly invited to.
- User data will be anonymized where possible, or clear consent will be obtained if personal data needs to be stored (e.g., attributing answers to specific users if desired, though this is not the primary goal for FAQ generation).
- The system will comply with Telegram's API terms of service and data privacy policies.
- Access to the raw chat data within the system will be restricted to authorized personnel.

**Considerations:**
- **Rate Limiting:** The bot will respect Telegram API rate limits to avoid being blocked.
- **Message Types:** The system will initially focus on text messages but could be extended to handle images or documents if they are relevant to Q&A pairs.
- **Scalability:** The ingestion pipeline will be designed to handle a high volume of messages from multiple chats.

## 2. Q&A Pair Identification

Identifying relevant questions and their corresponding answers is the core of this feature.

**Methods to Detect Questions:**
- **Keyword-based:** Messages containing common question-starting phrases ("how to", "what is", "why does", "can someone explain") or ending with a question mark ("?") will be flagged as potential questions.
- **NLP-based Question Detection:** A pre-trained NLP model (e.g., a classifier built on BERT or a similar architecture) will be used to identify questions with higher accuracy, understanding the intent even without explicit keywords. This model can be fine-tuned on a dataset of questions from similar technical domains.
- **Message Length and Structure:** Very short messages are less likely to be standalone questions, while messages with a certain structure (e.g., a problem description followed by a query) might be prioritized.

**Methods to Identify Corresponding Answers:**
- **Replies in Threads:** Direct replies to a flagged question message within a thread are strong candidates for answers.
- **Subsequent Messages:** Messages sent shortly after a question by other users, especially those identified as knowledgeable (e.g., project maintainers, senior developers), will be considered potential answers.
- **Reactions/Emojis:** Messages that receive positive reactions (e.g., üëç, ‚úÖ, üôè) or are explicitly acknowledged as helpful by the original asker can indicate a good answer. This can contribute to the confidence score.
- **Quoted Replies:** When a user quotes a question and provides an answer.
- **Similarity Analysis:** Vector embeddings of the question and potential answer messages can be compared for semantic similarity. An answer should be semantically related to the question.

**Confidence Scoring:**
Each identified Q&A pair will be assigned a confidence score based on a combination of factors:
- **Strength of question indicators:** NLP model confidence, presence of strong keywords.
- **Strength of answer indicators:** Direct reply, reply from a knowledgeable user, positive reactions, explicit acknowledgment.
- **Semantic similarity between question and answer.**
- **Length and clarity of the answer:** Concise and clear answers are preferred.
- **Time proximity:** Answers that appear soon after the question.

A threshold will be set for the confidence score to filter out low-quality Q&A pairs before they reach human moderation.

## 3. Human Moderation and Integration

Human oversight is crucial to ensure the quality and accuracy of the generated FAQs.

**Workflow for Human Review:**
- **Moderation Interface:** A simple web interface will be developed where moderators can view suggested Q&A pairs.
- **Review Process:** Moderators can:
    - **Approve:** The Q&A pair is accurate and useful.
    - **Edit:** Modify the question or answer for clarity, correctness, or to remove noise.
    - **Reject:** The Q&A pair is incorrect, irrelevant, or redundant.
    - **Merge:** Combine multiple similar questions or answers.
- **Digest/Notifications:** Moderators could receive a daily or weekly digest of new Q&A pairs awaiting review.
- **Feedback Loop:** Rejected or heavily edited pairs can be used as negative examples to fine-tune the Q&A identification models.

**Integration into PostgreSQL Database:**
- **Existing `qa` Table:** If the schema is compatible, approved Q&A pairs can be added to the existing `qa` table in the PostgreSQL database. This table is presumably used by the RAG process.
    - **Schema Considerations:**
        - `source`: A new category like "telegram_faq" can be added.
        - `question_text`: The approved question.
        - `answer_text`: The approved answer.
        - `confidence_score`: The score assigned by the automated system (for later analysis).
        - `moderator_id`: Who approved/edited the pair.
        - `timestamp_asked`: Original timestamp from Telegram.
        - `timestamp_answered`: Original timestamp from Telegram.
        - `telegram_message_id_question`: To link back to the original message if needed.
        - `telegram_message_id_answer`: To link back to the original message if needed.
- **New FAQ Table:** Alternatively, a new table `telegram_faqs` could be created with a similar schema, specifically for these generated FAQs. This might be cleaner if the structure or purpose differs significantly from the existing `qa` table.

**Avoiding Redundancy:**
- **Similarity Check:** Before suggesting a new Q&A pair for moderation, the system will perform a semantic search against the existing `qa` table and any other available documentation.
- **Moderator's Role:** Moderators will also be responsible for identifying and rejecting redundant Q&A pairs.
- **Linking to Existing Docs:** If a question is already well-answered in existing documentation, the moderator can choose to link to that documentation instead of creating a new FAQ entry.

## 4. Alignment with PRD Goals

This feature directly addresses several points outlined in the `QA/Meta/prd.md`:

- **"All discussions are happened in common Telegram chats and can be observable to integrate with Github issue tracker." (Problem 4):** While this feature focuses on FAQ generation, the core capability of processing and understanding Telegram chat data is a foundational step towards deeper integration, including issue prediction.
- **"Integrate all information flows between project's documentation, Github issues tracker, Telegram chats and code base" (Problem 5):** This feature specifically tackles the integration of Telegram chats into the knowledge base.
- **"Setup RAG process and make index of docs, codebase and Telegram chats." (High-level Goal):** By ingesting and structuring Q&A from Telegram, this feature enriches the dataset available for the RAG process, making it more comprehensive.
- **"Save all information in Postgres database for semantic and full-text search for RAG purpose." (High-level Goal):** Approved Q&A pairs will be stored in the Postgres database, directly feeding into this goal.
- **"Reduce time to answer tickets because documentation is sparse and very big." (Primary KPI 3):** By capturing common questions and answers from live discussions, the system helps build a practical and relevant FAQ knowledge base. This, in turn, allows the support team and users to find answers more quickly, reducing the need to repeatedly answer the same questions and addressing the sparseness of documentation with real-world solutions.
- **"Reduce time to update documentation based on predicted changes from Telegram and codebase." (Primary KPI 4):** While not directly predicting documentation updates, this feature surfaces common issues and solutions discussed in Telegram. This information can highlight areas where the official documentation is lacking or unclear, thus indirectly guiding documentation updates.

By transforming informal Telegram discussions into structured FAQs, this feature enhances the knowledge management capabilities of the project, improves support efficiency, and makes valuable information more accessible.
